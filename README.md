- 👋 Hi, My name is Gurmit and I work as a full stack develop
- 👀 I’m interested in building products that help solve complex problems. I like to build tools that help automate, leverage other open source tools and cloud native applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react to build my UI knowledge and expertise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on any open source or build in project projects.
- 📫 You may reach out to me on twitter @gurmitsarora
